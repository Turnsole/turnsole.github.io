This is the personal website of Chris Mabee. 

Opinions represented within are my own, unless otherwise cited, and are neither endorsed nor reviewed by my employer(s) or clients. Please direct any professional communication via my LinkedIn profile. Other topics such as corrections/suggestions to blog posts, or tips for where to find good cupcakes may be directed via twitter or the email address at the bottom of the page. Caveat: I mostly only check my Twitter feed on weekends, and even then only when I'm in a good mood.
